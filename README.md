# REACTNODE-Capstone Two

## A site that uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path through a saved maze or one the user created.
## If a user registers and logs in they can save the maze they created to the site. 

### Uses React frontend and Node backend.  
### Also used: PostgreSQL database for templates, Redux for UI, REACTstrap 

#### After you clone: npm install for both frontend and backend folders, and from the backend folder run psql -f data.sql in windows to seed the database (psql < data.sql for mac). 
#### Start your server from the backend folder with node server.js, then start React from the frontend folder with npm start, and you should be good to go!
